## Thoughts/Solution Process
Originally started out with vanilla JS using if, if else statements....
but then found [this solution using switch cases](https://stackoverflow.com/a/44633141/6615341). I don't yet have the knowledge or the tests to prove this is faster, but from the author's explanation, it makes sense to me why it would/could be as array sizes get larger.
